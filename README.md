This project idea is to help me understand dom-manipulation in vanilla JavaScript

how to use:
* press play
* click on a question (will work on the cursor pointers)
* type in input box and hit submit (it doesnt do anything at the current state)
* you will only be able to select a new question when you hit submit

All questions are in a separate JS file to simulate JSON like data. Questions are organized by category for each column
(nature, animals, computers, mythology, history, general)

extra notes:
An interesting consequence on making this game with pure JS, is that in a sense I am making a single-page application from sratch with no libraries (REACT). 

The code is obviously much more messy but that is because im following no tutorials for this project, just raw experimentation.
